# Data-Manipulation-with-Pandas

Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular data wrangling packages, Pandas works well with many other data science modules inside the Python ecosystem, PANDAS is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,built on top of the Python programming language. Inside this repository you will see a lot of notebooks with additional content that may complement the pandas library. I included some important Ipython concepts, string operations, built-in functions, timedelta and many complex and interesting data analysis projects using pandas. Whether you are not familiar with this powerfull library you will see how much better in terms of computation, manipulation and deep analysis you can do compared to other tools such as Windows Excel functionality. The most important jupyter notebook of this repository is the one called Data Manipulation with Pandas. It is based on the book "Python Data Science Handbook" written by Jake VanderPlas.
